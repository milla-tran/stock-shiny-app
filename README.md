The stock market can be just as risky as gambling. With uncertain choices and often large amounts of money on the line, people have attempted to 'figure out' the market for years. 

Many people regard success in the stock market as a game of pure luck. However, in life there is no such thing as luck, just adequate and inadequate preparation for a statistical universe.

This app has four features to assist users in answering the crucial "what-if" question when deciding how to invest.

- Allows the user to select certain stocks in order to observe the trend of the prices of the chosen stocks.
- Features a menu with a select panel with stock options such as Amazon and Netflix. 
- Provides a graph of the prices with distinct colors so that the user can compare between various stocks.
- Displays a reference line for mean price among the stocks featured. 
- Allows selection of sectors, industries, and multiple individual stocks for enhanced analysis.


We hope this app will help you make informed decisions and provide valuable insight into the positions and variance of different stocks on the market.
